# financial-data-scrape

## Overview
This is a project I worked on to scrape pitchbook for financial data on an array of companies. Most of the data was related to fundraising, specifically when each company last received funding, as well as the total amount raised to date. 

## How to run
Due to Pitchbook regulations, you are only permitted to log in to your account in a maximum of two browsers. As a result, you must first run the driver.py code to open an automated Chrome browser, then run the scraper.py code to attach at that URL and Server ID (which will be printed to the terminal). The data will be saved as a JSON.
